# Feynman's eclipse
## how does it work?
* First you start buy drawing a circle
* Then you pick a point in the circle that is not the center point
* Then the program calculates evenly distributed points on the circle
* It then connects them with the chosen point
* The program than rotates all the lines at the focus point of the line
